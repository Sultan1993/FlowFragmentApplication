# FlowFragmentApplication

This project showcases how FlowFragment works. Great amount of inspiration was taken from FlowViewController in iOS. 

Basically, it incapsulates the business flow into one Fragment. Additionally, Navigation Component is used to navigate between fragments inside flow.
There are extension functions which are able to pop | push | finishFlow. 

Soon I'll write an article on Medium and provide a link here.
